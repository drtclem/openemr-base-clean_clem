"""Runs all three eval suites and prints one clean, unified summary --
useful for demonstrating the whole eval story live (video, interview)
without piecing together three separate command outputs by hand.

Each suite's own detailed per-case output is suppressed here (run that
suite's own module directly for full detail); this prints only the final
counts, pulled live from each suite's real run -- nothing hardcoded except
the PRD-category-to-case-name mapping and the historical bug list, both of
which are explicitly static/traceable by design (see inline comments).

Usage:
    python3 -m evals.run_all
