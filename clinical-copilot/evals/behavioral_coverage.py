"""Behavioral Coverage: a broader, non-gated companion to cases.py's Golden
Set, per evals/COVERAGE.md's Golden Set vs. Behavioral Coverage distinction.

Built by actually reading 126 real conversation traces
(evals/trace_review_raw.md), naming what happened in plain language, then
clustering into the five categories below -- not generated from a generic
checklist, per COVERAGE.md's stated process.

Unlike cases.py's Golden Set, NOT every case here is expected to pass, and
nothing here is gated (see evals/run_evals_behavioral.py). A case not
passing is expected, useful information about where the agent's behavior
gets shaky across a wider range of phrasings and scenarios -- report it,
don't treat it as a build blocker.

Real finding surfaced while writing Category 1 (documented inline, and in
ERROR_ANALYSIS.md): app/verification.py's `_find_candidate_terms()` only
scans for literal substrings from `_ALL_TERMS`. Only "copd", "ckd", and
"afib" are bare-abbreviation entries in that vocabulary -- "htn", "t2dm",
"dm", "dm2", "mi", "chf", and "pcn" are NOT, meaning a claim using any of
those abbreviations is never even considered a "candidate needing
grounding" in the first place, regardless of `_CLINICAL_ALIASES`. This is
a real gap (a hallucination phrased with one of those abbreviations would
currently not be caught by source-attribution), left deliberately
un-fixed here so Category 1's cases show the actual current behavior
rather than a pre-patched one.
